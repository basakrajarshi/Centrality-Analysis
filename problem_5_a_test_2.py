    """Compute the eigenvector centrality for the graph G.
 
    Eigenvector centrality computes the centrality for a node based on the
    centrality of its neighbors. The eigenvector centrality for node `i` is
 
    .. math::
 
        \mathbf{Ax} = \lambda \mathbf{x}
 
    where `A` is the adjacency matrix of the graph G with eigenvalue `\lambda`.
    By virtue of the Perronâ€“Frobenius theorem, there is a unique and positive
    solution if `\lambda` is the largest eigenvalue associated with the
    eigenvector of the adjacency matrix `A` ([2]_).
 
    Parameters
    ----------
    G : graph
      A networkx graph
 
    max_iter : integer, optional
      Maximum number of iterations in power method.
 
    tol : float, optional
      Error tolerance used to check convergence in power method iteration.
 
    nstart : dictionary, optional
      Starting value of eigenvector iteration for each node.
 
    weight : None or string, optional
      If None, all edge weights are considered equal.
      Otherwise holds the name of the edge attribute used as weight.
 
    Returns
    -------
    nodes : dictionary
       Dictionary of nodes with eigenvector centrality as the value.
 
       
    Notes
    ------
    The eigenvector calculation is done by the power iteration method and has
    no guarantee of convergence. The iteration will stop after ``max_iter``
    iterations or an error tolerance of ``number_of_nodes(G)*tol`` has been
    reached.
 
    For directed graphs this is "left" eigenvector centrality which corresponds
    to the in-edges in the graph. For out-edges eigenvector centrality
    first reverse the graph with ``G.reverse()``.
